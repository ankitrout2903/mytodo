# Todo App with User Authentication, Server, Pylint GitHub Action, and Deployment

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of a Todo web application developed using HTML, CSS, and Django. The application includes user authentication features to ensure secure access to the todo lists. The server-side is implemented using Django to manage data storage and retrieval. Additionally, Pylint is integrated into the project as a GitHub Action to ensure code quality. The application is deployed for production use.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Django
- Pylint
- GitHub Actions
- Deployment Platform (e.g., Heroku)

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

Users can register for an account and log in securely to access their personalized todo lists. This ensures that each user has a private space to manage their tasks.

### 2. Todo List Management

Users can create, edit, and delete tasks within their todo lists. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently.

### 3. Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

### 4. Server-Side Implementation

The server-side is developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django handles data storage, retrieval, and user authentication, ensuring a robust and secure backend.

### 5. Code Quality Assurance with Pylint

Pylint is integrated into the project as a GitHub Action. This ensures that the code adheres to PEP 8 standards and maintains high-quality standards.

### 6. Deployment

The application is deployed to a production environment for public use. This could be on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or any other suitable service.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

### 1. Frontend

- **HTML Files:** The structure of the web pages.
- **CSS Files:** Stylesheets for a visually appealing and responsive design.

### 2. Backend

- **Django Models:** Define the structure of the database tables, including the User and Todo models.
- **Views:** Handle user requests and interact with the database.
- **URLs:** Define the URL patterns and routes for the application.
- **Templates:** HTML templates to render dynamic content.

### 3. Authentication

- **User Registration:** Allows users to create an account with a unique username and password.
- **User Login/Logout:** Secure login/logout functionality.
- **Session Management:** Ensure user sessions are secure and authenticated.

### 4. Todo Management

- **Task Creation/Editing/Deletion:** Enable users to perform CRUD operations on their todo lists.
- **Task Prioritization:** Optionally allow users to set task priorities.

### 5. GitHub Actions

- **Pylint Action:** Ensures code quality by running Pylint on each pull request or push to the repository.

### 6. Deployment

- **Deployment Configuration:** Configuration files for deploying the application to a production environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to access the Todo application.

## Code Quality Assurance with Pylint

Pylint is integrated into the project as a GitHub Action. The configuration file for Pylint (`pylintrc`) is included in the repository. Ensure that the code adheres to PEP 8 standards and passes the Pylint checks before making a pull request.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to a production environment for public use. The deployment process may involve configuring environment variables, setting up a database, and hosting static files. Refer to the deployment documentation for detailed instructions.

## Conclusion

This Todo application with user authentication, a Django backend, Pylint GitHub Action, and deployment offers a comprehensive solution for task management. Developers can build upon this foundation, ensuring code quality, security, and scalability in their projects.
